This repository, initiated by me in the summer of 2024, showcases the advanced capabilities of the Next.js framework for modern e-commerce, leveraging TypeScript for robust, maintainable code and adhering to SOLID principles for modular, scalable architecture.

In my ongoing research, I've used ChatGPT, JetBrains AI, and GitHub Copilot to tackle real-world challenges, focusing on performance optimization and user personalization. Based on these applications, Iâ€™ve drawn specific conclusions regarding the strengths and suitability of each AI tool for different development tasks.

Key decisions include Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to boost SEO and reduce load times, striking a balance between flexibility and performance for dynamic e-commerce platforms.
